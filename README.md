99 Problems in Haskell
======================

This is just a haskell version of the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) puzzle.

I probably got bored of this halfway through so it may not be complete.

This is structured into files named after the different sections in the original.
